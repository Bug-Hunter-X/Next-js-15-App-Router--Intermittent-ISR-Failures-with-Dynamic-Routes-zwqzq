# Next.js 15 App Router: Intermittent ISR Failures with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates an intermittent issue encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).  The problem manifests as pages not being updated even after successful revalidation, leading to stale content.

## Reproducing the Issue

Reproducing the issue is currently unreliable.  It seems to occur more frequently under load or after a period of inactivity. The provided code is a minimal reproduction;  more complex scenarios may exacerbate the issue.

## Potential Causes

Potential causes under investigation include:

* **Caching inconsistencies:**  A possible issue with the caching mechanisms within Next.js or its underlying infrastructure.
* **Race conditions:**  Concurrency issues between revalidation requests and client requests.
* **Edge network behavior:**  Inconsistencies in how the edge network handles ISR updates.

## Workarounds

Currently there is no reliable fix, only temporary workarounds.

* **Force revalidation:**  Manually trigger revalidation using the Next.js API to bypass the intermittent failure. This is not ideal for a production environment.
* **Simplify routing:**  Reduce complexity in routing logic to potentially reduce the likelihood of the bug.
* **Implement more robust error handling:** While not solving the root issue, this can help mitigate the impact of stale content.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome.  If you can provide a reliable way to reproduce this issue and insights into possible solutions, it would be greatly appreciated.
